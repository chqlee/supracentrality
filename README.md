# Supracentrality 
## Centrality Analysis for Multilayer, Multiplex and Temporal Networks

This code implements the supracentrality framework described in publications:

[1] D Taylor, MA Porter and PJ Mucha (2019) "Eigenvector-based centralities for multiplex and temporal networks are tuned by the topology of interlayer coupling." arXiv preprint available at XXXXXXX.

and

[2] D Taylor, SA Myers, A Clauset, MA Porter and PJ Mucha (2017) "Eigenvector-based centrality measures for temporal networks." Multiscale Modeling and Simulation 15(1), 537-574.

There are 3 demos that reproduce the results in paper [1].
